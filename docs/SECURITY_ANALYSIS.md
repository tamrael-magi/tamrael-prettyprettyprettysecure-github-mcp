- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only essential libraries (httpx, mcp, stdlib)
- **Modern Libraries:** httpx provides async HTTP with security features
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Fewer dependencies = fewer potential vulnerabilities

### A07: Authentication Failures - ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
**Strengths:**
- **Secure Token Management:** OS keyring prevents credential exposure
- **Bearer Authentication:** Industry-standard GitHub API authentication
- **No Hardcoded Credentials:** All tokens stored securely or in environment

### A08: Data Integrity Failures - ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
**Strengths:**
- **Secure Git Operations:** Multi-step API process with SHA verification
- **Atomic Operations:** GitHub API ensures data consistency
- **No Direct File System Access:** All operations through secure API

### A09: Logging Failures - ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
**Strengths:**
