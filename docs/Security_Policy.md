## Security Updates

**Tamrael PPPS GitHub MCP** takes security seriously. All critical security vulnerabilities identified and patched during development cycle.

### v1.0.0 (July 14, 2025) - INITIAL PUBLIC RELEASE WITH COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY
**Development Period: July 1-14, 2025 (2 weeks total)**

#### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES - Pre-Release Security Sprint
*All vulnerabilities discovered and patched during final security review before public release*

- **CVE-2025-TIMING-001** - Fixed timing attack vulnerability in repository validation
  - **Impact:** Prevented repository name enumeration through timing side-channels
  - **Fix:** Implemented constant-time comparisons using `secrets.compare_digest()`
  
- **CVE-2025-RACE-002** - Resolved race conditions in rate limiter implementation
  - **Impact:** Eliminated concurrent request bypass vulnerabilities  
  - **Fix:** Added thread-safe operations with `threading.Lock()`
  
- **CVE-2025-INJECTION-003** - Prevented command injection via branch name parameters
  - **Impact:** Blocked malicious branch names from executing system commands
  - **Fix:** Comprehensive branch name validation and input sanitization

#### 🛡️ CRITICAL: Vulnerable Fallback Logic Eliminated
**Issue:** Server could silently run with security vulnerabilities if security modules failed to import

**Security Impact:**
- **HIGH RISK:** Silent security degradation without user awareness
- **PRODUCTION DANGER:** Deploy-time import failures could create security holes

**Resolution:** Implemented fail-secure behavior - server exits with clear error if security components unavailable

**Recommendation:** v1.0.0 represents the first production-ready release with enterprise-grade security. No previous versions should be used in production.

## Security Architecture

### Current Security Protections

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- OS keyring integration for secure token storage
- Smart repository whitelisting with empirical 30-day threshold
- Risk-based operation classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Progressive security levels (STRICT/STANDARD/OPEN)

**Input Validation:**
- Comprehensive file path validation with path traversal prevention
- Branch name sanitization with command injection prevention
- Content size limits (1MB default) for DoS protection
- Unicode normalization and control character filtering

**Attack Prevention:**
- Timing attack prevention with constant-time comparisons
- Race condition prevention with thread-safe operations
- Command injection prevention via comprehensive input validation
- Information disclosure prevention in error messages

**Audit & Monitoring:**
- Optional CCTV cryptographic audit logging with hash chains
- Complete operation tracking with forensic capabilities
- Rate limiting with sliding window (60 requests/minute)
- Security event logging with tamper-evident trails

### Security-by-Construction Design

**Local-First Architecture:**
- Runs entirely on user's computer
- No external dependencies for core security functions
- Complete offline operation capability
- Zero data collection or tracking

**Fail-Secure Principles:**
- Fail-secure design with explicit allow patterns
- Mandatory security component loading (no silent degradation)
- Conservative default configurations
- Security-first exception handling

**Zero-Trust Implementation:**
- All operations validated against security boundaries
- Repository access requires explicit whitelisting
- Progressive security enforcement based on operation risk
- Continuous security validation throughout execution

## Threat Model

### Protected Against

**Input-Based Attacks:**
- Path traversal and directory climbing attacks
- Command injection via user inputs (branch names, file paths)
- Unicode-based attacks and control character injection
- Content-based DoS attacks (size limits enforced)

**Timing and Concurrency Attacks:**
- Timing attacks on repository validation
- Race conditions in concurrent operations
- Information disclosure through timing side-channels

**Credential and Authentication Attacks:**
- Credential exposure in logs or memory
- Token leakage through error messages
- Unauthorized repository access attempts

**AI-Specific Threats:**
- Prompt injection attempts via repository content
- Data extraction through operation chaining
- Repository enumeration through error analysis

### Current Limitations

**External Dependencies:**
- Security depends on GitHub's API security model
- Limited protection against malicious repository content
- Local system security remains user's responsibility

**Operational Constraints:**
- Rate limiting may impact high-volume operations
- Smart whitelisting requires 30-day activity for private repos
- STRICT mode limits functionality for maximum security

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Found a security issue? Please report responsibly.**

### 🚨 For Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please:

1. **Email:** ops@tamrael.com
2. **Subject:** "PPPS Security Issue - [Brief Description]"
3. **Include:**
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Impact assessment (who/what is affected)
   - Suggested fixes if you have them
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 72 hours (best effort)
- **Initial Assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Resolution Timeline:** Depends on severity and developer availability
- **Public Disclosure:** After fix is available (coordinated disclosure)

### What to Expect

**Priority Response:**
- ✅ **Critical security vulnerabilities** (actual CVEs, RCE, data exposure)
- ✅ **High-impact security issues** (authentication bypass, privilege escalation)
- ✅ **Well-researched vulnerability reports** with clear reproduction steps

**Lower Priority:**
- ⚠️ **Theoretical security concerns** without practical exploitation
- ⚠️ **General security questions** (use GitHub issues for these)
- ⚠️ **Feature requests** disguised as security issues
- ⚠️ **Issues already fixed** in current versions

### Security Research Guidelines

**Encouraged Research:**
- Testing with your own GitHub repositories
- Code review and static analysis of security functions
- Analysis of the cryptographic audit logging implementation
- Penetration testing of input validation and rate limiting

**Please Don't:**
- Test against repositories you don't own
- Attempt to access other users' data
- Perform DoS attacks against GitHub's infrastructure
- Share vulnerabilities publicly before coordinated disclosure

## Deployment Security

### Secure Setup

```bash
# Use OS keyring for token storage (recommended)
python tamrael_github_general.py setup

# Choose appropriate security level
python tamrael_github_general.py --security-level standard  # Default recommendation

# Enable optional audit logging (place overkill_audit_logger.py in same directory)
# Automatic activation - no additional configuration needed
```

### Security Level Recommendations

- **STRICT**: High-security environments, compliance requirements, manual repository control
- **STANDARD**: Most users, smart IP protection with convenient file operations (RECOMMENDED)
- **OPEN**: Development/testing only, NOT for production use with sensitive repositories

### Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Use STANDARD or STRICT security level (never OPEN in production)
- [ ] Verify OS keyring integration is working
- [ ] Test repository whitelisting with expected repositories
- [ ] Enable audit logging for compliance environments
- [ ] Verify rate limiting configuration is appropriate
- [ ] Test fail-secure behavior (rename security_validators.py temporarily)
