# ðŸŽ‰ Path Import Fix SUCCESS!

This file was created after successfully fixing the Path import issue in the GitHub MCP server.

## What was fixed:
- Added `from pathlib import Path` to `security_validators.py` 
- The Path import was missing from the security validation module
- This caused both `get_file_content` and `create_file` to fail

## Test Results:
- âœ… File content retrieval: WORKING
- âœ… File creation: WORKING (this file proves it!)
- âœ… All other features: WORKING

## Timestamp:

Status: All GitHub MCP features now fully functional!

## Next Steps:
The GitHub MCP server is now fully operational with all security features intact.
