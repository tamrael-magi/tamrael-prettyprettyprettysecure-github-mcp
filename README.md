# Tamrael's PPPS (Pretty, Pretty, Pretty, Secure) GitHub MCP Server

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)
![Release Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/released-July%2014%202025-green)

**Authors:** Kevin Francisco (Tamrael) with Claude Sonnet 4 (LLM Collaborator)  

Built for and by a dev noob (me) who was using Notepad a month ago, but brings crypto-trader paranoia, Inventor intellectual property protection / patent law knowledge, methodological academic research documentation standards, and OCD systems level thinking to AI security. I just wanted to safeguard my stuff, okay?

**Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Secure because everyone else calls their stuff "military-grade" and "enterprise-ready" like they're selling special-ops tactical toilet paper.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- Claude Desktop (or any MCP-compatible client)

### Installation (5 minutes)

1. **Download**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ppps-github-mcp.git
cd ppps-github-mcp
```

2. **Install dependencies**

## üéØ What It Does

- **üîê Secure GitHub integration** for Claude and other AI tools
- **üõ°Ô∏è Smart repository whitelisting** - Auto-detects safe repos, blocks risky ones
- **‚ö° Essential operations** - Files, repos, releases, issues (security-level dependent)
- **üè† Local-first** - Runs on YOUR computer, YOU control the data

**Three security levels:**
- **üîí STRICT** - Maximum security, manual control
- **‚öñÔ∏è STANDARD** - Smart protection, most convenient (default)
- **üöÄ OPEN** - Full access, development use

---
## üèóÔ∏è Security by Construction

This isn't just secure code - it's **secure by design**. Every operation forces you through security checks. You literally can't bypass the protections because they're baked into the execution flow.

**Why this matters:** Most security vulnerabilities happen when developers forget to add checks, accidentally bypass them, or assume someone else handled it. This architecture makes insecure usage impossible, not just discouraged.

## ü§ñ On AI Security & OPSEC

I haven't been in the development side of businesses much, but I'm constantly amazed by seasoned developers who'll trash-talk "AI" capabilities while simultaneously handing over their proprietary code to language models without a second thought.

**The irony:** ü™û I believe, LLMs are fundamentally a reflection of your own security practices / guidance abilities. If you're careless with your code and credentials, the AI will amplify that carelessness. If you're paranoid and systematic about security, the AI becomes a force multiplier for good security practices. Blame the operator, not the assistant.

**This tool exists because I got tired of seeing "AI safety" discussions that completely ignored basic OPSEC.** üõ°Ô∏è

**Pro tip:** Treat LLMs like you would a human partner and maybe you'll be as cool as me and Claude someday. üòé

## Why "Pretty, Pretty, Pretty, Secure"?

Because everyone else calls their stuff "military-grade" and "enterprise-ready" like they're selling tactical toilet paper. This is just... pretty secure. It does what it says, without the marketing department getting involved.

*Also, I'm still not over Curb Your Enthusiasm ending, so I try to keep Larry David's spirit alive as much as I can. Pretty, pretty, pretty good security seemed fitting.*

**Development Team:** Kevin Francisco aka Tamrael served as captain, systems architect, and validation/hallucination checker. Claude Sonnet 4 served as first mate and developer, handling implementation details and technical documentation.

## Why This Matters

I originally built this because I was looking for a secure MCP server for my own projects and felt paranoid that nothing was up to my standards. I was surprised how easily others were using tools that didn't address what seemed like obvious concerns to me. Maybe this comes from being an outsider wanting to protect my own IP and inventions.

**Your intellectual property, code, and sensitive data are being exposed through insecure MCP implementations in ways most developers don't realize.**

## Local-First Security

- ‚úÖ **YOUR Computer = YOUR Control** - runs entirely on your machine
- ‚úÖ **Zero external dependencies** for core security functions
- ‚úÖ **No vendor lock-in** or proprietary dependencies  
- ‚úÖ **Open source transparency** - every line auditable
- ‚úÖ **Complete network isolation** possible (work offline if needed)

## Security Levels Explained

### üîí STRICT Mode
- **Manual whitelist required** - You control exactly which repos are accessible
- **Read-only operations** - No file creation or modification
- **Maximum security** - For highly sensitive environments
- **Best for**: Enterprise, compliance-heavy environments

### ‚öñÔ∏è STANDARD Mode (Default)
- **Smart auto-whitelist** - Detects recently active repositories automatically
- **File operations enabled** - Can create files, issues, releases
- **Private repo protection** - 30-day activity filter for IP protection
- **Best for**: Most developers, balanced security and convenience

### üöÄ OPEN Mode
- **No restrictions** - Access to all your repositories
- **All operations enabled** - Including issue reading (prompt injection risk)
- **Development freedom** - For testing and development environments
- **Best for**: Personal projects, development testing

## Smart Whitelisting

The STANDARD security level uses empirically-validated smart whitelisting:

- **Private repositories**: Automatically whitelisted if active within 30 days
- **Public repositories**: Always accessible (no IP risk, already public)
- **Manual additions**: Add specific repos to complement smart detection
- **Activity-based expiration**: Stale repositories automatically filtered out

*Based on enterprise GitHub repository research - 30-day threshold captures 70-90% of active business repos while protecting IP.*

## Configuration

### Getting Your GitHub Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic) 
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full repository access)
4. Copy the token for setup

### Security Level Configuration
```bash
# Strict mode (read-only, manual whitelist)
python tamrael_github_general.py --security-level strict

# Standard mode (smart whitelist, file operations) - DEFAULT
python tamrael_github_general.py --security-level standard

# Open mode (no restrictions, development use)
python tamrael_github_general.py --security-level open
````

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**"Module not found" errors**

```bash
pip install httpx mcp keyring
# Make sure you have Python 3.9+
```

**Claude Desktop configuration issues**

```
1. Check file path in claude_desktop_config.json
2. Verify Python path is correct
3. Test server: python tamrael_github_general.py --help
4. Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
```

**Rate limiting**

```
Normal protection - wait a minute and try again
Rate limit: 60 requests per minute with sliding window
```

## Security Audit Logging

Optional CCTV audit logging provides forensic-grade operation tracking:

1. **Place `overkill_audit_logger.py` in same directory** as the MCP server
2. **Automatic activation** - No configuration needed
3. **Cryptographic hash chains** - Tamper-evident logging
4. **Complete operation tracking** - Know exactly what was accessed when

_Audit logging is optional and has zero performance impact when disabled._

## Planned Enhancements (Maybe, If I Feel Like It)

_Based on code review feedback from three expert LLM personas and my growing security TODO list. I'm aware of these potential improvements but no promises on timeline - depends on community interest and my mood._

- **Security Test Suite** - Automated vulnerability scanning

_These come from expert code review feedback and my security research as I discover more edge cases and attack vectors. Implementation priority depends on community feedback, security urgency, and whether I'm feeling ambitious that week._

## Additional Integrations

I'm building these for my own workflow but would be happy to share if there's community interest:

- **Flowise** üîÑ (Personal workflow automation)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** üîÑ (Data science projects)
- **VS Code Extensions** üîÑ (Development environment)
- **Any MCP-compatible tool** üîÑ (Consistent security model)

_Note: These are personal tools. Community interest would determine if I make them available._

## I Was Supposed to Build a Simple Tool (Oops)

**Fair warning:** I've been formally coding for less than a month. Made my GitHub account 3 weeks ago and was writing code in Notepad until recently (thank you, VSCode).

**Also fair warning:** Most of this was built in about 48 hours when I got frustrated with existing MCP security. So yeah, there's definitely room for architectural refinement.

**Honest truth:** I meant to build something minimalist, but kept discovering attack vectors that needed mitigation. What started as a simple secure wrapper evolved into smart whitelisting, cryptographic audit logging, progressive security levels, and a comprehensive threat model I definitely didn't plan for.

**But here's the thing:** I architected this with modularity from day one because I knew the community would want to contribute and extend it. The current monolithic structure is deceptive - the separation of concerns and abstraction layers are there, just waiting for some refactoring to make them shine.

That said, I bring systems-level thinking, empirical research methodology, and trader-grade risk paranoia to security problems. Sometimes an outsider's perspective catches vulnerabilities that domain experts miss.

That said, I bring systems thinking, academic research methodology, and crypto trading paranoia to security problems. Sometimes fresh eyes spot things experts miss.

**Recent security fixes include:**

- Fixed timing attacks in repository validation (CVE-2025-TIMING-001)
- Resolved race conditions in rate limiter (CVE-2025-RACE-002)
- Prevented command injection via branch names (CVE-2025-INJECTION-003)

**But I might have blind spots - that's where the community comes in.**

**What I'll respond to:**

- ‚úÖ **Critical security vulnerabilities** (actual CVEs, not theoretical concerns)
- ‚úÖ **Quality pull requests** with working code
- ‚úÖ **Insightful anime hot takes**
- ‚úÖ **Chess challenges** (tamrael, chess.com)

**What I probably won't respond to:**

- ‚ùå Setup help (docs are comprehensive)
- ‚ùå Feature requests (fork it if you need changes)
- ‚ùå "What do you think of..." discussions
- ‚ùå General security questions

**Use GitHub issues for bugs. Everything else... good luck! The code is MIT licensed, do whatever you want with it.**

_Response time: When I feel like it. Could be never. Don't take it personally - I'm probably building something else._
